<div class="post-content">
<p> If someone would have told me a week ago that I would be able to make a <strong>website</strong>, I would have thought they were crazy. But I never gave up i have always wanted to make a website from scratch.</p>
<p>Just a few days later, I came across Mimo ( check the link to mimo at the bottom of the page) and started to work on this blog. I got Atom and started coading this website from scratch. I have always dreamed of creating my own website. I also want to start designing other peoples blogs </p><br>
